## Personalising the Portfolio

All content — profile info, experience, projects, and skills — is centralised in **[`src/constants.ts`](src/constants.ts)**. To make this portfolio your own:

1. Update the `profile` object with your name, title, email, social links, and about text.
2. Replace entries in the `experiences` array with your own work history.
3. Add your projects to the `projects` array, drop screenshots into `src/assets/projects/`, and update the imports.
4. Adjust `slugs` (the tech-icon globe) and `skillSet` to reflect your skill set.
5. Swap out your photo at `src/assets/me.png`.

---

## Deployment

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages via the `gh-pages` package.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `npm run build` first (via the `predeploy` hook) and then pushes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

The `homepage` field in `package.json` controls the base URL:

```json
"homepage": "https://abhishekdeshmukh.com"
```
